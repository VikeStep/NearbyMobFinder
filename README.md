NearbyMobFinder

Minecraft Forum Post: http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2125500

Current Features
---------------------
This mod will tell you all the nearby mobs when you get the following message trying to sleep:
"You may not rest now, there are monsters nearby"

Currently does this by putting the co-ordinates of the mobs in the minecraft chat (only to the player who used the bed)

There is also a config option (disabled by default) to let you search for nearby mobs at any given time. Simply press "u" (this can be changed in controls).

Future Planned Features
-----------------------
- A better way of showing nearby mobs
- A config option to customise distance checked for nearby mobs

Download
----------------------
All downloads are now on CurseForge

3. run gradlew setupDecompWorkspace

Modpacks
-----------------------
You are free to use it in modpacks, but it would be awesome if you could tell me about it beforehand.
