NearbyMobFinder
===============

This mod will tell you all the nearby mobs when you get the following message trying to sleep:
"You may not rest now, there are monsters nearby"

Currently does this by putting the co-ordinates of the mobs in the minecraft chat (only to the player who used the bed)

Future Planned Features
-----------------------
- Ability to find nearby mobs at any time of day (disabled by default in config)
- A better way of showing nearby mobs
