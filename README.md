Current Features
---------------------
This mod will tell you all the nearby mobs when you get the following message trying to sleep:
"You may not rest now, there are monsters nearby"

Currently does this by putting the co-ordinates of the mobs in the minecraft chat (only to the player who used the bed)

Download
----------------------
Downloads are available in the Releases folder on github.

[The latest can be found here](https://github.com/VikeStep/NearbyMobFinder/releases/tag/1.0.0-15w32a)

Compiling
----------------------
If you want to compile the latest (as it might not be in the releases)

1. clone this repo
2. create a folder called build and put the jar of the minecraft version this was used for inside it
3. run gradle build

Modpacks
-----------------------
You are free to use it in modpacks, but it would be awesome if you could tell me about it beforehand.
